# Pseudo Code:
# 1. Take user input for the string, width, and optional fill character.
# 2. Check if the string length is already greater than or equal to the width.
# 3. If yes, return the string as is.
# 4. If no, append the necessary number of fill characters to reach the width.
# 5. Print the padded string.
