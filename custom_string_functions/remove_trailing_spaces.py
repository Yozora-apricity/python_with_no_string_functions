#Pseudo Code:
# 1. Define a function remove_trailing_spaces that takes a string as input.
# 2. Initialize an index variable to the last character position in the string.
# 3. Loop backward through the string:
#    a. If the current character is a space, decrement the index.
#    b. If the current character is not a space, break the loop.
# 4. Return a substring from the start to the last non-space character.
# 5. Take user input, call the function, and print the result.
