#Pseudo Code:
# 1. Define a function right_justify_manual that takes a string and a width as input.
# 2. Calculate the number of spaces needed by subtracting len(string) from width.
# 3. If spaces needed is less than or equal to 0, return the string as is.
# 4. Otherwise, return a new string with the required spaces prefixed.
# 5. Take user input, call the function, and print the result.
