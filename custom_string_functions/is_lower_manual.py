#Pseudo Code:
# 1. Define a function is_lower_manual that takes a string as input.
# 2. Iterate through each character in the string:
#    a. If any character is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z'):
#       - Return False.
# 3. If the loop completes without finding an uppercase letter, return True.
# 4. Take user input, call the function, and print the result.
