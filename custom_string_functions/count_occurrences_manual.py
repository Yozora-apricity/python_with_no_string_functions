#Pseudo Code:
# 1. Define a function count_occurrences_manual that takes a string and a substring as input.
# 2. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
# 3. Iterate through the string with a loop:
#    a. Use slicing to check for occurrences of the substring.
#    b. If a match is found, increase the counter and move the index forward.
# 4. Return the counter value.
# 5. Take user input, call the function, and print the result.
